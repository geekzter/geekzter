I'm Eric, a Cloud Solution Architect with Microsoft based in Amsterdam, helping customers to get the most out of Azure. 
I use GitHub to demonstrate what's possible with Azure and get customers going. As most of what I do is demo ([Minecraft](https://github.com/geekzter/azure-minecraft-docker) being the exception) and therefore only created when I need it, I use a lot of automation (Azure CLI, Azure Pipelines, Codespaces, GitHub Actions, PowerShell, Tarraform). 

Below is a list of some of my work.
